## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

This homework was very challenging. I wasn't able to save the initial and score but managed to get the quiz to work with some support from my colleagues and also have to do some research in order to get it to work. I use some new words such as queryselector, forEach, toString() and appendChild() and I find it super useful.
